### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics for all subjects  
- Distribution analysis of scores  
- Correlation between Math, Reading, and Writing  
- Identification of subject-wise weaknesses  
- Conclusion: **Math has more low scores compared to Reading and Writing**

### 📈 Data Visualizations
- **Histograms**: Show the distribution of scores across different gender and ethnic groups.  
- **Boxplots**: Identify outliers in student performance across subjects.
