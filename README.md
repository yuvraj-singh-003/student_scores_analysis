# Student Result Analysis

This project provides a complete analysis of student performance across three key subjects: **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing**.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations, insights, and automatically generated reports in PDF, DOCX, and PPTX formats.

---

## ⭐ Project Highlights

### 📊 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics for all subjects  
- Distribution analysis to identify low and high performers  
- Correlation checks between Math, Reading, and Writing  
- Identification of subject-wise weaknesses (Math shows more low scores)

### 📈 2. Data Visualizations
- Boxplots comparing subject performance  
- Histograms showing score distributions  
- Trend and comparison charts  
- Visual evidence of consistently weaker Math scores  

### 📄 3. Generated Reports
- **PDF report** summarizing the findings  
- **DOCX report** for editable documentation  
- **PPTX presentation** for quick insights  
- **PDF export of PPT** for easy sharing  

### 🧪 4. Jupyter Notebook Workflow
- Complete workflow: data loading → cleaning → exploration → visualization 
- Well-structured and reproducible
